In a time of ratcheting frustration, ubiquitous anxiety, and slow-moving disaster, most young men feel misplaced, misconstrued, misshapen.

I teach a few disciplines which have helped me find a way out of that deadlock. The important thing is to do something *creative* with the inner torment of firstworld misery.

##### Craft

It begins simply: go outside. Walk.

Woodcraft, construction and offgrid living, hunting and wilderness training: there's medicine in all these things. One day you may find yourself pouring concrete in the desert, chopping firewood in the mountains, or skinning your first rabbit.

##### Qigong

I teach 氣功 Qigong and a martial form known as 六合八法 Liuhebafa. It will make you stronger from the inside out.

##### Shamanic initiation

When the tribe is failing, the gifted ones retreat to the wilderness to seek answers. I can show you how to leverage psychosomatic disease to find medicine.
