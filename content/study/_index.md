I teach meditation and psychoanalysis on a remote basis. My methods are effective because they are tested, distilled, and unencumbered by metaphysical nonsense.

## Background

* Meditation: 20+ years of practice. I've studied within the Buddhist, Yogic, Native American, and Daoist disciplines: from each I learned something essential I'm prepared to pass on.
* Psychoanalysis: I have postgraduate-level training within New York psychoanalytic circles, with direct lineage to Lacan.
* Engineering: I'm a former software engineer and lifelong student of practical engineering, including offgrid living. I approach spirituality with the precision and robust standards more commonly found in these fields.

## Method

We discard the absurd fantasies and priestly agendas which have plagued meditative practice: I teach meditation and self-development as a form of remedial neuronal training. We're interested in the frontiers of human potential: my method seeks to exploit nonlinear emergence via conditioning of the many unconscious subsystems, which produces a far greater yield of intelligent behaviors at the conscious niveaux than the usual topdown approach.

When this method works, you should become more intelligent yet receptive, energetic yet restful, imaginative yet factual, playful yet serious.

## Details

Remote sessions weekly. Personalized desert retreats available: let the big blue sky and the yellow dirt transform you. We will camp, meditate, walk, talk, and do.

Sliding scale fees. Scholarships and discounts for those who qualify. If you want to work with me, say so: I will teach anyone who's passionate.
