## Meditation

We study meditation as a form of *remedial neuronal training*. We're interested in the frontiers of human potential: our method seeks to exploit nonlinear emergence via conditioning of the many unconscious subsystems, which produces a far greater yield of intelligent behaviors at the conscious niveaux than the usual topdown approach.

## Psychoanalysis

Training in unconscious semantics is one of the most powerful weapons available in the war for spiritual growth. I can teach you to employ that vast domain of intelligence and intuition which most of us cannot reliably access.

## Psychedelia

Episodic psychedelic intervention by a qualified practitioner is one of the most effective treatments for a variety of depressions, addictions, and traumas. Some of these exotic metabolic chains can stimulate neural regrowth within core areas responsible for long-term memory, emotive association, and sense of self. There's no better time than the present to find your path.
