In a time of frustration, anxiety, hypocrisy, and slow-moving disaster, I help young men find a path.

Until we can laugh about our pain, until we find a place for our aggression, until we become brave and true.

Through disciplines of the body and mind, through ritual, through hard work with our hands, through the most mundane realities and esoteric visions: we must become whole human creatures. No one but yourself can make this future, I can only teach you to pray and become worthy of your prayer.

## Craft

Woodcraft, musical instrument building, construction and offgrid living, hunting and wilderness training: there's medicine in all these things. One day you may find yourself pouring concrete in the desert, chopping firewood in the mountains, or skinning your first rabbit.

## Shamanic initiation

When the tribe is failing, the gifted ones retreat to the wilderness to seek answers. I can show you how to leverage psychosomatic disease and psychotic fragmentation to find medicine.

## Psychoanalysis

Training in unconscious semantics is one of the most powerful weapons available in the war for spiritual growth. I can teach you to employ that vast domain of intelligence and intuition which most of us cannot reliably access.

## Meditation

We study meditation as a form of *remedial neuronal training*. We're interested in the frontiers of human potential: our method seeks to exploit nonlinear emergence via conditioning of the many unconscious subsystems, which produces a far greater yield of intelligent behaviors at the conscious niveaux than the usual topdown approach.
