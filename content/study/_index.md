Through discipline, through ritual, through hard work with our hands, through mundane realities and hidden visions: we must become whole human creatures.

## Craft

It begins simply: go outside. Walk.

Woodcraft, construction and offgrid living, hunting and wilderness training: there's medicine in all these things. One day you may find yourself pouring concrete in the desert, chopping firewood in the mountains, or skinning your first rabbit.

## Qi Gong

I teach Qi Gong and a martial form known as Liuhebafa. It will make you stronger from the inside out.

## Shamanic initiation

When the tribe is failing, the gifted ones retreat to the wilderness to seek answers. I can show you how to leverage psychosomatic disease to find medicine.
