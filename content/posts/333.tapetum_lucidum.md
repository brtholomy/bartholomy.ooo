My latest book on consciousness and meditation is [now available][book].

A guide for the spiritually disenchanted. Neuroscience is made to pay up: to yield insight, reasons to be brave, reasons to endure the discipline and comedy that genuine meditative practice entails.

Buy it, review it, love it, hate it, throw it on the ground, throw it out your car window, leave it at your mom's house, burn it, sleep with it under your pillow, wake up and try again.
