Bartholomy in conversation with Dr. Şiyar Bahadır, a neurosurgeon and researcher at the Feinstein Institutes in NYC.

We've been talking regularly for the last few months. Our conversations tend to be situated somewhere between neuroscience, psychology, anthropology, and computational modeling. In this recording we're discussing psychosomatic medicine, the shamanic ritual, network theory, and our own emerging "science of subjectivity."
