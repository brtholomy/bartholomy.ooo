Friends, readers.

I've been working on my next book, and it's nearly done. It's more or less a "hostile takeover of evolutionary psychology". At least half of the material hasn't been published online yet, so there's plenty to look forward to.

I could use help proofing it. I could hire someone, but I'd prefer to keep it more familial. If you'd like to read an advance copy and report typos, I'll repay your time with free classes, consultation on any work of your own, and a free copy when it's finished. You don't have to commit to the full 100k+ words - a chapter or two is fine.

In any case, thank you for your readership. My gratitude to those who support this work financially: I intend on continuing to earn your confidence.
