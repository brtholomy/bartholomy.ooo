The situation in the 21st century, is that any psychology which does not ground itself in the ethological fundamentals is worthless drivel: either one ends up promoting vague, fashionable, animistic "syndromes" such as the psychiatrists do; or droning on about Upanishadic fantasies like "objectless prelinguistic desire" as the worst psychoanalysts do. *We are animal*: now is the time to take this realization more seriously than ever before. Psychology has been until now, and continues to be, the "story of the soul", just as its name translates: the problem is not so much this name and idea, as it is with the postaxial degradation of the definition of "soul". *Psyche* used to mean "living essence", and not "consciousness" nor "mind" nor "human person": it means that which *animates*, that which is *constituted by animation*, that which is discernible *as a living whole*.

*In animo volvere*. I've tried employing the term "cognitive science" to describe what I do, but there's something about the word "cognitive" that leaves a foul aftertaste. Those who use the word "cognition" do so to explicitly exclude unconscious valence - *intentionally and unconsciously*. You see I cannot take a single step without violating the limits of everything that's currently ascendant in psychology, anthropology, neuroscience, and the study of intelligence. "Cognitive assassin" might be more apt. But as a scholar and stubborn philologist, I'd rather revive and baptize venerable terms: there's nothing wrong with the term *psychologia* nor this "story of the soul". And even the word "soul" has etymological hues I can live with: tracing the Old English *sawol* gives us the clue of the Greek αἰόλος, meaning "quick", and we arrive at the Proto-Indo-European **ṷel-**, meaning "to turn". This leads us to familiar words like "volume", or "the waltz": to have a soul is to keep the wheel turning. To be alive is to move. This is the same sense in which *psyche* was used, along with *animus*, 气, and a whole pantheon of ancient ideas revolving around breath, motion, "quickening". Psyche is a measure of vitality, and therefore psychology is "the story of being alive". - And what lives embraces a great deal more than "cognition". In contrast, the ridiculous problem with the term "cognitive science" is that translated from the Latin, it comes out to mean "knowledge of knowledge". And this is precisely what its advocates want: a knowledge only of that which is known. *A science of the conscious*. And this they achieve, and thus everything produced under its aegis is shallow, brimming with worthless taxonomies, ad hoc idiosyncratic abstractions which have nothing to do with personal experience, nor sustained observation, nor anything at all to do with the deeper history of psychology. They're constantly reinventing the field from naïve hearsay and willful ignorance. The popular voices in this field manufacture consoling tabulations, quarantining sources of anxiety with prettily painted picket fences and green grass on *both sides*, so that everyone gets to feel humane, included, and safe from *the It* which is namelessly excluded. If I were to recast my work alongside theirs, I would rather it be called the "incognitive science", the knowledge of unknowledge, the story of the repressed.
