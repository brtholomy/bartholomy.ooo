A few months before he killed himself, I saw Phillip Semour Hoffman on the street in the Lower East Side. It was late, and I was walking to the subway through one of those uniquely warm yet strangely desolate New York nights. I recognized him at least a block away: he was standing outside a bar, alone, smoking a cigarette under a street lamp like an animated mannequin. He noticed me, and understood that I knew who he was: he looked at me with a contempt I shall not forget. But I didn't look away, even as I walked toward him: few can best me in that game. He knew that I knew that he knew: and so it proceeded, for a few tense moments... I don't remember who looked away first, perhaps I did: his indifference and subdued rage seemed indefatigable. I came away from the story feeling sobered, perhaps respecting him more, perhaps less: as though he were alone in such contempt! As though there were no one in all the world to befriend, as though this human gaze, this understanding, were necessarily inadequate: but he did *not want to be understood* - that much became clear. If it were possible to be transparent and intelligible to a stranger on the street, what might he lose? Would he lose his self-respect? Would he succumb to the contempt he needed so badly as consolation, armor, and identity? Perhaps I looked away first: but did he also know that I looked away not from fear, but pity? That I pretended for a moment not to understand, for his sake - and did that offend him all the more? Or did he see me squirm towards compassion, and therefore feel vindicated? Do not doubt that this much is possible in a few moments between complex souls: dreams are a dilation, and fencing with a tortured artist will demonstrate your limitations like none other.
