My name is T. Bartholomy. I live offgrid in the high desert of Nevada. I teach, write, and listen. I specialize in helping men repulsed by effeminate and moralizing psychotherapy. My methods work well for depression, addiction, and ennui.

I have a unique background. Some highlights are the psychoanalytic training in NYC, a philosophy education in Germany, ethnological study of healing ceremony with the Lakota Sioux and the Shipibo of Peru, and a stint in engineering at Google.

My goal is to address emergent 21st century problems with the power of *humanitas* in the ancient sense: to be a complete human creature, to seek health in all its transpositions, to become more intelligent with a holistic strength of body and a rocksteady emotional platform. My work strives to combine the imaginative potential of the traditional *medicine path* with the rigor and precision of the scientific method, bridged and tuned by meditative discipline.
